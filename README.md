Our application is available at: http://entertainmentrecommender.herokuapp.com/

### Overview:

Our web application recommends the most popular movies and TV shows by genre. Upon arriving to our website, a user will be prompted with the choice to search for movies or TV shows. Once the user selects one of these options, they will choose a particular genre that they are interested in viewing from the following choices: Action, Adventure, Animation, Comedy, Drama, Horror, Romance, and Sci-Fi. Based on the entertainment type and genre the user selected (i.e. action movie), our application queries the MovieDB API to obtain a list of results that we then display on our website in order of popularity. The user can then select each result to see various information about it, including the title, release date, rating, overview, and trailer (if there is one available).
